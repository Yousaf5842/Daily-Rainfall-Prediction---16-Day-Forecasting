# Daily-Rainfall-Prediction---16-Day-Forecasting
machine learning project on rainfall forecasting! 🌦️ Using LSTM, BiLSTM, XGBoost, and Random Forest, this model predicts daily rainfall for the next 16 days based on real-time weather data.
🔹 Project Highlights:
📡 Real-Time Data Integration – Fetching weather data via Open Meteo API
📅 Historical Dataset (2020-2024) – Collected from Open Meteo for Chakwal
📊 Feature Engineering – Aggregated hourly weather variables into daily features
⚖️ Preprocessing – Data normalization & outlier detection
🤖 Model Training & Evaluation – Compared multiple models, Random Forest with Hyperparameter Tuning performed best
⚡ Live Predictions – Normalizing real-time data & forecasting rainfall for 16 days
